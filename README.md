# Carpool App

## About 

The Carpool application is currently being used by IBMers to carpool to and from work in Toronto, and we are hoping to add some new features to it so we can deploy to more locations

## Development notes

Every once and a while we should remember to make a pull request from master back to Peter, being that he was the main contributer on this project before he left IBM and the main repo is still on his profile
